# AvaliaJa

This project, named "Rate it now" in portuguese, aims to make people aware of their health.
You can find information about healthy habits and can also perform important calculations for medicine and nutrition.

All this information was taken from official pages and was verified by a nutritionist.

For this project: In HTML, I learn about organization; In CSS, I learn a lot about the user experience and I'm learning about an responsive web;
    In JS: I've to lean more about functions and how they comunicate.
